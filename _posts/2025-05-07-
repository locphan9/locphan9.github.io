Word2Vec based on the Skip-Gram model in Mikolov et al 2013.

The advantage of Skip-Gram is its fast and gives accurate repreentation of word vectors, instead of relying on distances and angles. 

Mikolov, Sutskever et al 2013 paper aims to speed up hirerachical softmax from Mikolov et al 2013, and plot the relationship between words. 

Pennington, Socher, Manning, 2014 paper aims to improve the "localization" statistics in Word2Cev by utilizing co-ocurance matrix, better at capturing global semantic relationship
